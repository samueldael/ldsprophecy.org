<title>The Redemption of Zion</title>
<META NAME="description"
CONTENT= "Zion is described during the 62nd week of Christianity or during the confirmation of the covenant according to Daniel. Because the redemption of Zion was delayed by the Lord in the last section of the Doctrine and Covenants, we must assume that he knew what would happen and therefore eclosed prophecy with the instruction given for building the land of Zion. There was only hope in Christ that Zion could be redeemed but prophecy said otherwise. The references below are almost all as it pertains to establishing Zion. The Mormons call themselves Zion but it is not redeemed and it is not heaven on the earth. Mormons simply retain the Law of Moses as a tithe and the power of the priesthood is to seal covenants but not individuals. The work for the dead goes on but Zion failed in obtaining redemption.">

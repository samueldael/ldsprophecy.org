<title>A History of Heaven</title>
<META NAME="description"
CONTENT= "The very first line of the Old Testament is: In the beginning, God created the heaven…  This was mentioned at the beginning of this site section, God created the Kingdom of Heaven as a form of laws before man was even naturally on the face of the planet we mistakenly call earth. Instead of heaven being in the clouds, it is a kingdom with laws. It is not a physical place we might seek. It is a way of living. It is our natural tendency to be attracted to an ideal place in the sky to live, where we are accepted and the beauty comes specifically from our own imagination.">

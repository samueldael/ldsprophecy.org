<title>Allegory of the Seventy Weeks</title>
<meta name="description" content= "Seventy weeks is a period of time. It was not, however for us to know the units of timing. The Lord kept it in allegory so the carnal mind would use the natural tendency to apply the timing to the secular events of the time the prophecy was given. This is the nature of man. No one has the ability to see through the allegory unless the Lord allows one to see. If this section is even reasonable, human nature will still side with their own tradition and to the authority they sustain. If they can see, they will ask God for more. " />

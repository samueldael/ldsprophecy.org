<title>The Head of Gold</title><meta name="description" content= "The times and seasons mentioned by the Lord would not be had among the apostles. Mormons would certainly agree that the fall of Christianity through the dark ages would most certainly cover any attempt to understand the times and the seasons. The question remains did the current members and prophets understand the times and the seasons? Did Joseph Smith receive such knowledge? Daniel’s interpretation of the great image gives a secular result of the future and every religious interpretation from the Jew to the protestants at the time of the restoration offer a similar knowledge as to the times and season of this dream. If the Lord creates darkness, why do we think we knoe the truth? " />

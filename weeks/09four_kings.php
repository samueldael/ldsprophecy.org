<title>The Four Kings</title><meta name="description" content= "This is Daniel’s last vision. It is also a prophecy of Christianity with more emphasis on all four kingdoms, but even more on the forth kingdom of Iron. There are more verses in the Four Kings than the other visions and dreams. This vision is in the first year of Darius the Mede. It is interesting that Daniel confirmed and strengthened Darius. Today we have disrespect not only to political leaders, but also to our own churches—anything to show our denial of our own fear.">

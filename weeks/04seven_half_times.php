<title>The Seven Half Times</title><meta name="description" content= "Those who think they can understand Daniel with Just the Great Image are led astray as most are until the time of the end. When we see for the first time we can then understand all the visions of Daniel. This article will emphasize the 1260 days or the seven half times. Seven half times is not in scripture but is represented by time, times and half a time, forty and two months are also used in scripture for the desolations that exist between the abomination and the redemption of Zion. Desolations means darkness at noonday. We first have to understand the desolation of abomination in the last days. " />

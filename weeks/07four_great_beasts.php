<title>The Four Great Beasts</title><meta name="description" content= "In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters. This is a vision of Daniel and not a dream of the kings. It is a prophecy of Christianity from the first to the last, which is the Redemption of Zion. No one has been able to interpret Daniel until now—the time of the end. All of history must have been accomplished until such prophecy can be interpreted. The only reason the Redemption of Zion is included is because it fits the 69th week of Daniels seventy-week prophecy of Christianity.">

<title>Ram and He Goat</title><meta name="description" content= "This is Daniel’s second vision. It is also a prophecy of Christianity with emphasis on the fourth kingdom of Iron. It passes the kingdom of gold but illustrates more the Redemption of Zion that will come without hand. One cannot understand without knowing Christian History as well as LDS history. This is the reason tradition rises because of the negative impact of prophecy.

The Redemption of Zion is more paramount because of Daniel’s 69th week. This exists in all prophecy even though the LDS tradition applies prophecy pertaining the redemption to the restoration. It makes the negative appear positive.">

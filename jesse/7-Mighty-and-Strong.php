<title>One Mighty-and-Strong</title>
<meta name="description" content= "The Lord uses different names to prophecy of the same event. The reason for this is to keep the prophecy from being understood because the nature of man is to think that different names mean different events. It is also essential to use different terms to preserve the message incase one is deleted or interpreted incorrectly. The One Mighty and Strong is the Rod of Jesse and if the Church tries to silence the meaning of one the reference to the other remains. As we shall see in the last article, BYU tries to link all to Joseph Smith and personal history has tried to link the One Mighty and Strong to a bishop at the time of Joseph Smith. This illustrates the tendency to preserve tradition, custom, and ingrained opinion that avoid the need of any new servant. The reason is that it causes skepticism toward current leaders, which must be avoided at all costs." />

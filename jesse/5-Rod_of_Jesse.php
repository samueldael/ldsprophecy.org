<title>The Rod of Jesse</title>
<meta name="description" content= "The Rod of Jesse is a biblical term and has little to do with intellectual theory. It is also allegorical where physical things are like unto Spiritual things. Rod and Jesse are temporal things. The rod pertains to a new shoot out of the trunk or stem of a fruit-bearing tree. Jesse is a historical person or Hebrew king. Specifically he was the father of David and of the tribe of Judah. In Hebrew, David would be called “Son of Jesse” (Ben Yishai). " />

<meta name="description" content= "This article is about the Stem of Jesse, the Rod of Jesse, and the Root of Jesse. It however tries to prove by precedence that Joseph Smith is both the Root and the Rod. This comes from tradition because the Church does not like any new servants to come. Many hint to some extent they fulfill the coming of a special servant, but they are not. All that modern scripture has is, I, the Lord God, will send one mighty and strong, holding the scepter of power in his hand, clothed with light for a covering, whose mouth shall utter words, eternal words. This is not mentioned in this article and this servant has the same qualities as the Rod of Jesse. Are we saying the Joseph Smith is the one mighty and strong?  " />

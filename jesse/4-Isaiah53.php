<title>The Rod of Jesse or Sposkman</title>
<meta name="description" content= "The allegory of this prophecy is avoided other than Joseph Smith is the servant in the last days. The Mormon Church does not seem to be able to see that the spokesm refered to is yet to comes. Joseph is campared to Moses and the Spokesm will declare what Joseph could not see. The prophecy uses a comparison between Moses and Joseph Smith and also between Aron and the spokesman. The two latter day servants are the Root of Jesse and the Rod of Jesse." />

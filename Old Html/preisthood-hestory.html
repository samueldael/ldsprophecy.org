/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

    <h2>Preisthood History from Abraham to Joseph Smith</h2>
    <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
   <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="article" -->
   <p>The most detailed reference to the priesthood comes to us  from Genesis, the Apostle Paul, and Joseph Smiths translation during the time  of Abraham. I will use the latter first: &ldquo;And Melchizedek lifted up his voice  and blessed Abram. Now Melchizedek was a man of faith, who wrought  righteousness; and when a child he feared God, and stopped the mouths of lions,  and quenched the violence of fire. And thus, having been approved of God, he  was ordained an high priest after the order of the <strong><em>covenant which God made with  Enoch</em></strong>, It being after the order of the Son of God; which order came,  not by man, nor the will of man; neither by father nor mother; neither by  beginning of days nor end of years; but of God; And it was delivered unto men  by the calling of his own voice, according to his own will, unto as many as  believed on his name&rdquo; .   (JST Genesis  14:25-29 Compare with Genesis 14:18-20). When man is approved of God he is  ordained a High Priest after the <strong><em>order</em></strong> of the covenant which God made  with Enoch. This order was after the <strong><em>order</em></strong> of the Son of God. When we  consider the use of order we first think of the order in which thing appear as  in who comes first, second, third, and so forth. We then think of order as in  the Order of the Priesthood exemplified in all Christian Churches as something  like Bishop, Priest or Deacon—implying the first meaning. &nbsp;Historically,  the word &quot;order&quot; (Latin&nbsp;<em>ordo</em>) designated an established  civil body with a hierarchy, and&nbsp;<em>ordinatio</em>&nbsp;meant legal  incorporation into an&nbsp;<em>ordo</em>. The word &quot;holy&quot; refers to  the&nbsp;Church. In context, therefore, a holy order is set apart for ministry  in the Church. This implies position of order from the highest to the least to  administer the needs of the order. We have leaned two things out of tradition  Genesis. One is the order of leadership and the other is the Order or  community. When you dwell on the leadership, you mean the priesthood, but when  you dwell on the people, you mean the principles they live by. The above  reference indicated <strong><em>a covenant which God made with Enoch. </em></strong>We know that the city of  Enoch indicated and order in which the saints lived, but what does it mean to  be a high priest after this order, which was also after the order of the Son of  God? Does it mean the order is simply and order of high priests, an order in  which the high priests administer, or an order in which the high priests live  according to some covenant that God makes with them? &ldquo;For God having sworn unto  Enoch and unto his seed with an oath by himself; that <strong>every one being ordained</strong> after this order and calling should have  power, by faith, to break mountains, to divide the seas, to dry up waters, to  turn them out of their course; To put at defiance the armies of nations, to  divide the earth, to break every band, to stand in the presence of God; to do  all things according to his will, according to his command, subdue  principalities and powers; and this by the will of the Son of God which was  from before the foundation of the world. And men having this faith, coming up  unto this order of God, were translated and taken up into heaven&rdquo; (JST Genesis  14:31-32 compare with Genesis 14:18-20). The covenant was with Enoch and his  seed that if sufficient faith is demonstrated and everyone being ordained after  this order would have power to break the mountains of central control, divide  and understand the knowledge of the Lord so as to turn it out of the course of  tradition, and divide the saints and break every band they are under. If you do  not like the interpretation, you can create your own, but remember the literal  is like unto the spiritual and if you stay too literal, the event will never  happen because the literal hides the spiritual and keeps it from corruption.  Note that everyone being ordained would have this power. If all had the  priesthood, how do we get a hierarchy or some order of authority? This should  answer the former question.&rdquo;</p>
   <p>&ldquo;And now, Melchizedek was a priest of this  order; therefore he obtained peace in Salem, and was called the Prince of  peace. And his people wrought righteousness, and obtained heaven, and sought  for the city of Enoch which God had before taken, separating it from the earth,  having reserved it unto the latter days, or the end of the world; And hath  said, and sworn with an oath, that the heavens and the earth should come  together; and the sons of God should be tried so as by fire. And this  Melchizedek, having thus established righteousness, was called the king of  heaven by his people, or, in other words, the King of peace. And he lifted up  his voice, and he blessed Abram, being the high priest, and the keeper of the  storehouse of God; Him whom God had appointed to receive tithes for the poor&rdquo; (JST  Genesis 14:33-38 compare with Genesis 14:36-38). Melchizedek and the people of  Salem like unto Enoch wrought righteousness and for their faith. They obtained  heaven—not an afterlife heaven, but a heaven on the planet, otherwise why  mention peace in Salem? King Melchizedek set up Salem after the order of Enoch,  which God had taken from the people before. It is interesting the Lord promised  Enoch the city would return in the latter days. Melchizedek was not in the  latter days, which would indicate the Redemption of Zion would be a fitting  conclusion of this promise. The people called Melchizedek the king of  heaven—another reason this is heaven on the physical planet earth. The king of  heaven is also a king of peace suggesting no bonds or control by powers.  Melchizedek a high priest of the order blessed Abraham who was keeper of the  storehouse of God. It was Abraham specific duty to keep this storehouse for the  poor.</p>
   <p>&ldquo;Wherefore, Abram paid unto him tithes of all that he had, of all  the riches which he possessed, which God had given him more than that which he  had need. And it came to pass, that God blessed Abram, and gave unto him  riches, and honor, and lands for an everlasting possession; according to the  covenant which he had made, and according to the blessing wherewith Melchizedek  had blessed him&rdquo;   (JST Genesis 14:39-40  Compare with Genesis 14:18-20). These last verses are enlightening because they  add something tradition does not see. Abraham paid tithes to King Melchizedek  from this storehouse. According to the Mosaic method, this was tithes of tithes  or if the storehouse being the tithes collected from the people then Abram paid  1 percent of the total collected to the King. Abraham paid a tithe of his  tithes collected. Now consider this is Joseph Smiths record and yet the Mormon  Church does not practice tithes of tithes. All tithes go directly to the king  or the Church central treasury.</p>
   <p>Consider if in modern times each county  paid a tenth of its collection to the state and the state a tenth of its  collection to the Federal Government. Like the Mormon Church, the government  does not follow the plan of God and thus we suffer the bonds of an abusive  government in the same way the Kingdom of Iron has iron teeth. Man cannot  understand the knowledge of the Lord and thus cannot free himself from these  bonds. If one local community lived the order of Enoch and desired the name of  the order of the Son of God, perhaps we could eventually only redeem Zion and  the constitution if man could have such faith. God blessed Abraham riches more  than he had need because of his faith and the faith of those in his community.  Do we not want the same blessings? Before we can consider this, we need to  learn more. Just because Abraham paid tithes of the tithes collected, whom did  he collect from and how large was his community? If Abraham was a high priest  after this order, can we assume that all the male members were high priests  living the same principles? Are Mormons or any other person thinking about this  try to think of the hierarchy in this community in order to see where they  might fit? If such is ever the case, it is the first sigh that the order will  eventually fail, because the first thing man thinks of is his honor and  position or the idolatry that lingers in his heart. The priesthood would have  to fit an order of discussion as if every man was a prophet in such a way for  every priesthood holder to have an equal opportunity to speak. Decisions must  be unanimous and smaller forums must elect representative to higher forums  until the highest decides in unity to the whole. This fuses the Order of Enoch  into the Order of the Priesthood as one thing. Man by nature seeks a position  greater in order to place himself above as leader. He does not want to become  servant to all. This nature thrives on a democracy of majority rule while God&rsquo;s  order thrives on common consent in a republic. OOOO  <strong>A Look  at Paul&rsquo;s View:</strong> &ldquo;For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most  high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and  blessed him; To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by  interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which  is, King of peace; Without father, without mother, without descent, having  neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God;  abideth a priest continually&rdquo; (Hebrews 7:1–3). This compares equally with  Joseph Smith. &ldquo;Now consider how great this man <em>was,</em> unto whom even the  patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils&rdquo; (Hebrews 7:4). This is in  contrast to Joseph Smith. Is Paul wrong or is Joseph Smith. Spoils implies a  tithe of income and generally suggests the reason why the Protestants accepted  this view. There is more from Paul, but first we must give the view from  Genesis.</p>
   <blockquote>
     <p>&ldquo;And the king of Sodom went out to meet him  after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that <em>were</em> with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which <em>is</em> the king&rsquo;s dale. <em>And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth  bread and wine: and he was the  priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor  of heaven and earth: And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered  thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.</em> And the king of  Sodom said unto Abram, <strong>Give me the  persons, and take the goods to thyself</strong>. And Abram said to the king of  Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor  of heaven and earth, That I will not <em>take</em> from a thread even to a  shoelatchet, and that<strong> I will not take  any thing that <em>is</em> thine</strong>, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram  rich: Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men  which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion&rdquo; (Genesis  14:17–24)</p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>     Notice that the mention of Melchizedek in italics is  sandwiched between the mention of king of Sodom and Abraham. Actually all kings  were together in Joseph&rsquo;s translation, but Abraham&rsquo;s conversation between Sodom  and himself ended its completion before Joseph mentioned the grand details  about Melchizedek. In the Hebrew English, the above is identical other than a  bit of spelling. You can speculate how Joseph was able to elaborate, but when  the King of Sodom said to Abraham, &ldquo;Give me the persons and take the goods to  thyself&rdquo; was his thanks for saving the people of Sodom. Abraham said, &ldquo;I will  not take anything that is thine.&rdquo; This does not agree with Paul&rsquo;s rendition  that Abraham paid tithes of the spoils. Paul assumed spoils because he was a  Roman Soldier and that was the pattern, or someone after him changed things to  fit their view of tithing. Desperately needed, clarification came with Joseph  Smith and his inspired solution. Now back to Paul. &ldquo;And verily they that are of  the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment  to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren,  though they come out of the loins of Abraham: But he whose descent is not  counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the  promises. And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. And  here men that die receive tithes; but there he <em>receiveth them,</em> of whom  it is witnessed that he liveth. And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth  tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. For he was yet in the loins of his father,  when Melchisedec met him&rdquo; (Hebrews 7:5–10). Paul introduces the sons of Levi as  receiving the priesthood, but this was after Moses—a lesser priesthood. Paul is  not clear in explaining that Levi is a descendant of Abraham and one of the  tribes of Jacob. Paul assesses that those not counted of the lesser priesthood  received a portion of the tithes collected by Abraham. The Levitical priesthood  did not exist so those, perhaps woman and children not of the High Priesthood,  received tithes of Abraham according to their needs. This is where the lesser  receive the blessing of the better. No other idea will work when Abraham paid  tithes of the tithes collected to Melchizedek and the remainder he returned to  the poor in need.</p>
   <p>&ldquo;If therefore perfection were by the Levitical  priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need <em>was  there</em> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and  not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there  is made of necessity a change also of the law&rdquo; (Hebrews 7:11–12). Paul is  talking about a need to change the Law of Tithing from the Mosaic Law to that  of Christ because Christ was a High Priest after the order of Enoch and not  after the order of Aaron a Levite as was Moses also a Levite. Did the Levites  after Moses practice a different tithe? It was a tithe of increase off the  land, while Abraham paid tithes of all he possessed. In our day, it is the  difference between an income tax and a property tax. None of Christianity including  the Mormon Church can make the distinction that the two priesthoods had  different laws as Paul so eloquently illustrated. Paul goes on to say one must  come after the order of Melchizedek. This was Christ. He had the power to make  one a High Priest after the Order of the Son of God without an oath of  punishment. This would take another article to explain, but essentially these  High Priests were offered eternal grace for living the Law of Christ—the Order  of Enoch.</p>
   <p><strong>Truth Regarding Moses: </strong>Israel  after Moses had the priesthood, but it was of a lesser order as also were the  laws that came with the priesthood. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob had the higher  priesthood as well as the Order of Enoch, but by the time Israel fell into  bondage for many years under Egyptian rule, they lost everything. Israel needed  a Moses and the power of God to bring the higher priesthood back with the order  of the same.</p>
   <p>&ldquo;And the sons of Moses, according to the Holy Priesthood  which he received under the hand of his father-in-law, Jethro; And Jethro received  it under the hand of Caleb&rdquo; (Doctrine and Covenants 84:6–7). It is natural to  assume that Moses received the higher Priesthood. Then comes Moses on the  mount. What did he receive there? &ldquo; And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up to me  into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a <strong><em>law</em></strong>,  and <strong><em>commandments</em></strong> which I have written; that thou mayest teach them&rdquo; (Exodus 24:12). The law and  commandments sound like two concepts. I maintain he received the Order of Enoch  as well as the temporal commandments that the Order of Enoch fulfills. The  higher or Melchizedek priesthood administers the Order of Enoch, but where came  the lesser priesthood, which administered only the carnal commandments? When  Moses brought instructions of the Lord, written in stone, down from the mount,  he realized Israel could not live them. In his anger, he broke the tablets.</p>
   <p> &ldquo;And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the  calf, and the dancing: and Moses&rsquo; anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out  of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount&rdquo; (Exodus 32:19). Moses realized  the Law or Order of Enoch would be impossible because they could not even obey  the first commandment. As instruction by the Lord, &ldquo;And Moses went up into the  mount, and a cloud covered the mount. And the glory of the Lord abode upon  mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called  unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud&rdquo; (Exodus 24:15–16). After the Lord  covered instructions over forty days for building the Arc of the Covenant  included through chapter 31—seven chapters later, &ldquo;And he gave unto Moses, when  he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of  testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God&rdquo; (Exodus 31:18).  This was the second time God had written tables of stone. Jewish tradition  assumes that God gave the same laws as before.</p>
   <p>&ldquo;And the Lord said unto  Moses, Hew thee two other tables of stone, like unto the first, and I will  write upon them also, the words of the law, according as they were written at  the first on the tables which thou brakest; but it shall not be according to  the first, for I will take away the priesthood out of their midst; therefore <strong>my <em>holy  order</em></strong>, and the ordinances thereof, shall not go before them; for my  presence shall not go up in their midst, lest I destroy them. But I will give  unto them the law as at the first, but it shall be after the law of a carnal  commandment; for I have sworn in my wrath, that they shall not enter into <strong><em>my  presence</em></strong>, into my rest, in the days of their pilgrimage. Therefore do  as I have commanded thee, and be ready in the morning, and come up in the  morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me, in the top of the  mount&rdquo; (JST Exodus 34:1-2 compare with Exodus 34:1–9). Joseph Smith Clarifies  again. The use of <em>&ldquo;my holy order&rdquo;</em> should have made it clear to the Mormons that this was the Order of Enoch,  which was after the Order of the Son of God. I have never met a Mormon who  understands. They attribute this holy order to the higher priesthood and temple  marriage, the requirement of which demands the obedience to a Mosaic law of  tithe. Remember the use of <em>my presence.  </em>OOOO <strong>Another  Revelation:</strong> &ldquo;Which Abraham received the priesthood from Melchizedek, who  received it through the lineage of his fathers, even till Noah; And from Noah  till Enoch, through the lineage of their fathers; And from Enoch to Abel, who  was slain by the conspiracy of his brother, who received the priesthood by the  commandments of God, by the hand of his father Adam, who was the first  man—Which priesthood continueth in the church of God in all generations, and is  without beginning of days or end of years. And the Lord confirmed a priesthood  also upon Aaron and his seed, throughout all their generations, which  priesthood also continueth and abideth forever with the priesthood which is  after the holiest order of God. And this greater priesthood administereth the  gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the  knowledge of God. Therefore, in the ordinances thereof, the power of godliness  is manifest. And without the ordinances thereof, and the authority of the  priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifest unto men in the flesh; For  without this no man can see the face of God, even the Father, and live&rdquo; (Doctrine  and Covenants 84:14–22). We learn the following: Abraham received the  Priesthood through the linage of his fathers. The description works backwards  from Noah, to Enoch, to Abel, and starting with Adam. This higher priesthood is  without beginning of days or end of years. Based on an eternal principle and  not a hierarchy of authority, this higher priesthood follows the natural law of  conservation that abides forever. This higher priesthood holds the keys to the  knowledge of God if all become prophets according to the school of this priesthood—all  having an equal opportunity to teach and learn. In this ordinance, or school of  the prophets, the power of God is manifest in the flesh. Without this man  cannot see the face of God or endure his presence. &ldquo;Now this Moses plainly  taught to the children of Israel in the wilderness, and sought diligently to  sanctify his people that they might behold the face of God; But they hardened  their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his  wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore that they should not enter  into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory. Therefore,  he took Moses out of their midst, and the Holy Priesthood also; And the lesser  priesthood continued, which priesthood holdeth the key of the ministering of  angels and the preparatory gospel; Which gospel is the gospel of repentance and  of baptism, and the remission of sins, and the law of carnal commandments,  which the Lord in his wrath caused to continue with the house of Aaron among  the children of Israel until John, whom God raised up, being filled with the  Holy Ghost from his mother&rsquo;s womb&rdquo; (Doctrine and Covenants 84:23–27). The Jews  had only the Priesthood of Arron because they could not endure the presence of  God—meaning his holy priesthood and the Order of Enoch. They lived the lesser Mosaic  Law of tithe until John who came and said the Kingdom of Heaven was at hand.  John restored all things—meaning the principles of the Order of Enoch and  Christ sealed the Holy Priesthood upon those who lived according to the Laws of  Heaven.</p>
   <p>Heaven becomes a complete concept of the individual priesthood  holder seeing the face of God—as in knowing him; loving others as himself—as in  living the Order of Enoch; and becoming a prophet—as in knowing all things.  These blessing follow them that have such faith. They can change the course of  knowledge, rise others from darkness, and free those in bondage. As the Lord  said he would restore the priesthood before the redemption of the redemption of  Zion, for the redemption must needs come by power. &ldquo;But verily I say unto you,  I have decreed that your brethren which have been scattered shall return to the  lands of their inheritances, and shall build up the waste places of Zion. For  after much tribulation, as I have said unto you in a former commandment, cometh  the blessing. Behold, this is the blessing which I have promised after your  tribulations, and the tribulations of your brethren—your redemption, and the  redemption of your brethren, even their restoration to the land of Zion, to be  established, no more to be thrown down. Nevertheless, if they pollute their  inheritances they shall be thrown down; for I will not spare them if they  pollute their inheritances. Behold, I say unto you, the redemption of Zion must  needs come by power; Therefore, I will raise up unto my people a man, who shall  lead them like as Moses led the children of Israel. For ye are the children of  Israel, and of the seed of Abraham, and ye must needs be led out of bondage by  power, and with a stretched-out arm. And as your fathers were led at the first,  even so shall the redemption of Zion be. Therefore, let not your hearts faint,  for I say not unto you as I said unto your fathers: Mine angel shall go up  before you, but not <strong><em>my presence. </em></strong>But I say unto you: Mine angels shall go up before  you, and also my presence, and in time ye shall possess the goodly land&rdquo; (Doctrine  and Covenants 103:11–20). The Lord held back Moses and his presence—being the  higher priesthood as the children of Israel entered the Promised Land. Before Zion&rsquo;s  Final Redemption, the Lord will restore the Priesthood and the administering of  angels. How then would the priesthood become essential if the sun goes down  over the prophets? There is this gift and power of the priesthood that few  realize. It is in obtaining the knowledge of the Lord without the hand of the Church  controlling what the priesthood teaches, hears and practices. &ldquo;For where two or  three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them&rdquo; (Matthew  18:20). &ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I said unto my disciples, where two  or three are gathered together in my name, as touching one thing, behold, there  will I be in the midst of them—even so am I in the midst of you. Fear not to do  good, my sons, for whatsoever ye sow, that shall ye also reap; therefore, if ye  sow good ye shall also reap good for your reward&rdquo; (Doctrine and Covenants  6:32–33). &ldquo;As also through your administration the keys of the <strong><em>school  of the prophets, which I have commanded to be organized</em></strong>;  That thereby they may be perfected in their  ministry for the salvation of Zion, and of the nations of Israel, and of the  Gentiles, as many as will believe; That through your administration they may  receive the word, and through their administration the word may go forth unto  the ends of the earth, unto the Gentiles first, and then, behold, and lo, they  shall turn unto the Jews. And then cometh the day when the arm of the Lord  shall be revealed in power in convincing the nations, the heathen nations, the  house of Joseph, of the gospel of their salvation&rdquo; (Doctrine and Covenants  90:7–10). The Lord had commanded but the Mormon Church has abolished. The priesthood  as two or more can take up the school of the prophets at any time by gathering  and agree on any one thing. This was the intent of the Lord, but Satan has  turned it into a hierarchy of one commanding in all things. If any soul attempts  to suggest the redemption of Zion is to come, his comments become smothered  over by traditional remarks pointing only to those above, selected by one and  intimidated to consent by all. With this type of idolatry, the school of the  prophets cannot survive. Thus, the church discourages discussion naturally by  those wishing to maintain control and keep their honor and power. This will not  prevent the Lord from revealing his power to the priesthood. Wait and you will  see.</p>

/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

    <h2>The Final Redemption</h2>
    <!-- InstanceEndEditable -->
   <!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="article" -->
   <p><strong>The Final Redemption: </strong>This is the end of all Prophecy. You cannot read  a single prophet without some mention or association the final redemption.  Since I ended with Revelation 12, I will begin with it.</p>
   <p>&ldquo;And I heard a  loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the  kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our  brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. And  they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony;  and they loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore rejoice, <em>ye</em> heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of  the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he  knoweth that he hath but a short time&rdquo; (Revelation 12:10-12). Because the end  for Satan is near, we should know that a final tribulation must come, but  before that day, Zion will receive redemption without hand in the most  troubling of times.</p>
   <p><strong>Daniels Main  Prophecy: </strong>&ldquo;Know therefore and understand, <em>that</em> from the going forth  of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the  Prince <em>shall be</em> seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street  shall be <strong>built again</strong>, and the <strong>wall, even in troublous times</strong>&rdquo; (Daniel  9:25). This gives the time of the redemption as 2050, which was 1260 days or  seven half times from the abomination of 1844. The wall go up &ldquo;again&rdquo; meaning  it stood for a moment at the time of Joseph Smith. As most can see the  conditions of the world, it will definitely happen in troublous times.</p>
   <p><strong>The Great Image: </strong>&ldquo;Forasmuch as thou  sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it  brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the  great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and  the dream <em>is</em> certain, and the interpretation thereof sure&rdquo; (Daniel 2:45).  The redemption corresponds to the stone kingdom created without hands. The Lord  had to wait until man can rise, understand, and accept without tradition or or  depending on someone learned to tell him what to do. We have to redeem Zion by  the knowledge we learn from the Holy Spirit and not from any man.</p>
   <p>We must  understand that Joseph Smith did not have a full knowledge of the church  falling from heaven. He wrote in 1831 these words: &ldquo;The keys of the kingdom of  God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence shall the gospel roll  forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain  without hands shall roll forth, until it has filled the whole earth&rdquo; (Doctrine  and Covenants 65:2). Joseph understood the concept of the stone as most  Christians did. Other religions also claim to be the stone kingdom because of  the prophecy. In 1831, Joseph realized he was responsible for restoring the  priesthood and other keys. He would be sure to interpret that the new church  was the stone kingdom. All leader follow the same tendency. The above section  sixty-five is short and is not in the first person of the Lord. It is a prayer  offered by Joseph Smith. Mormons assume God will correct a prophet if he errs.  Prophecy does not agree with this. If the prophet errs, the Lord does not  correct unless the prophet asks specifically as Joseph often did. Joseph never  asked about the stone kingdom and perhaps it was best to assume incorrectly  because the church must fall before the redemption.</p>
   <p><strong>The Four Beasts:</strong> <strong> &ldquo;</strong>I beheld till the thrones were cast down,  and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment <em>was</em> white as snow, and  the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne <em>was like</em> the fiery  flame, <em>and</em> his wheels <em>as</em> burning fire. A fiery stream issued and  came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten  thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the  books were opened. I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which  the horn spake: I beheld <em>even</em> till the beast was slain, and his body  destroyed, and given to the burning flame. As concerning the rest of the  beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for  a season and time. I saw in the night visions, and, behold, <em>one</em> like the  Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and  they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory,  and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his  dominion <em>is</em> an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his  kingdom <em>that</em> which shall not be destroyed&rdquo; (Daniel 7:9–14).  Because this has not yet happened, I cannot  be specific. The thrones cast down power center in the world that loose there  power over the earth. The Ancient of Days is Adam. This might imply a  resurrection, but if Adam has performed the role of the Holy Ghost since after  his death, then he has great power to fill the hearts of men that they may  establish the waste places of Zion without hand. Thousands time ten thousand  will administer through him. The books are opened may only be a prejudgment of  those living if they can demonstrate the required righteousness. Because of  great words which the horn spake, Daniel beheld till the beast was slain. The  great horn began with Brigham Young, but the great words lasted for hundreds of  years until the words finely suffered destruction in a burning flame. The Lord  prolongs the rest of the beasts for a season and time.</p>
   <p><strong>The Ram &amp; He Goat: &ldquo;</strong>After the great  words were ended that changed the times, and laws, judgment shall sit &ldquo;and they  shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy <em>it</em> unto the end.   And the kingdom and dominion, and the  greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people  of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom <em>is</em> an everlasting kingdom,  and all dominions shall serve and obey him. Hitherto <em>is</em> the end of the  matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance  changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart&rdquo; (Daniel 7:26–28). This is  similar to the four beasts and the last lines did not give peace to Daniel. </p>
   <p><strong>From Isaiah: </strong>&ldquo;Woe to the crown  of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty <em>is</em> a fading  flower, which <em>are</em> on the head of the fat valleys of them that are  overcome with wine!  Behold, the Lord  hath a mighty and strong one, <em>which</em> as a tempest of hail <em>and</em> a  destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to  the earth with the hand&rdquo; (Isaiah 28:1–2). This tells of one who must come and  reveal those who drink strong doctrine and overcome with wine. He will destroy  and cast down to the earth without hand those who have troubled the Lord. There  are many prophecies regarding this, but the reader might think that I am the  one mighty. I prefer only to say that he will become the primary one to redeem  Zion without hand. The redemption will happen after I am gone.</p>
   <p>&ldquo;And I will  turn my hand upon thee, and purely <strong>purge  away thy dross</strong>, and take away all thy tin:  And I will <strong>restore thy judges as at the first</strong>, and thy counsellors as at the  beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the  faithful city. <strong>Zion shall be redeemed  with judgment, and her converts with righteousness</strong>&rdquo; (Isaiah 1:25–27). Dross  is something regarded as worthless. As late as the last century to the present  day, Israel retains the title of a worthless nation by many enemies. The Book  of Mormon indicates the American Indian comes from the tribe of Joseph. They  suffered brutally under modern man and under the bonds of a federal government.  Zion to this day suffers darkness. The Lord tried to redeem Zion with the early  Mormons, but the Lord again delayed it with Brigham Young. Those Mormons who  say all is well in Zion simply exalt themselves and certain doctrines to prove  their worth. They to suffer from the dross of worthlessness by other  Christians.</p>
   <p>Isaiah alternates from the state of Israel&rsquo;s abomination to  the promised redemption. This prophecy predicts the darkness that comes first  after Joseph Smith. &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord, Where <em>is</em> the bill of <strong>your mother&rsquo;s divorcement</strong>, whom I have  put away? or which of my creditors <em>is it</em> to whom I have sold you?  Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for <strong>your transgressions</strong> is <strong>your mother put away</strong>.  Wherefore, when I came, <em>was there</em> no  man? <strong>when I called, <em>was there</em> none to answer?</strong> <strong>Is my hand shortened</strong> at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my  rebuke I <strong>dry up the sea</strong>, I make the  rivers a wilderness: their <strong>fish stinketh</strong>,  because <em>there is</em> no water, and <strong>dieth  for thirst</strong>. I clothe the <strong>heavens  with blackness</strong>, and I make sackcloth their covering. The Lord God hath  given me the <strong>tongue of the learned</strong>,  that I should know how to speak a word in season to <em>him that is</em> weary:  he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned&rdquo; (Isaiah  50:1–4). Our mother&rsquo;s divorcement refers to our Church as the bride of Christ  when the Lord divorces her. The Lord is asking to whom and where he has sold  His bride. The Lord put our mother away because of our transgressions. When I  called Joseph Smith, was there none to answer. This is so fitting, but the  Mormon cannot see their own demise any more than ancient Israel could see  theirs at the time of Christ when he first called. The Lords hand is not  shortened, but because we reject the Order of Enoch (withheld form Israel from  Moses to John) the Lord dries up the sea of knowledge, He makes the rivers a  wilderness. The fish (all of us) stinketh because there is no water or knowledge  of the Lord and we die for thirst. Because we refuse to accept the Order of the  Son of God, this heaven we reject is clothed in sackcloth so we as Mormons do  not see what we rejected when the same is covered in blackness. God gives us  the toungue of the leaned so we lean only to speak to the weary. We waken only  to hear the words of the leaned and of those who control us.</p>
   <p>In Isaiah&rsquo;s  next chapter the message is reversed. &ldquo;Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall  return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy <em>shall be</em> upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; <em>and</em> sorrow and  mourning shall flee away&rdquo; (Isaiah 51:11). You can read all of Isaiah and note  this continued cycle. Just as the first Church suffered darkness and then came  the light to Joseph Smith, the Mormons suffer darkness until the redemption. </p>
   <p><strong>From Jeremiah:</strong> &ldquo;And I will  deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the  hand of the terrible&rdquo; (Jeremiah 15:21). Jeremiah continues much as Isaiah but  few may never come to see it.</p>
   <p><strong>From  Hosea:</strong> &ldquo;Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them!  because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they  have spoken lies against me&rdquo; (Hosea 7:13). Hosea indicates, though Israel  receives redemption at times, it still speaks lies. Why the Mormons cannot see  their lies is because the nature of man always goes into denial when he  receives something he does not deserve. He either rejects it outright or turns  it into something magical or something he can control without the help of the  Lord. His new idea, claimed to be from the Lord, provides the one in denial to  get the honor he seeks. Is not this the problem that Satan suffers? The  doctrines of Brigham Young came out of the sea or knowledge of the Lord, but  they expressed denial in order to obtain the honor he sought. Mormons do not  change these new doctrines, the embrace them because they obtain power unto  themselves. They worship authority for the honor and do not question the  learned.</p>
   <p><strong>Revelation 14: </strong>&ldquo;And I  looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty <em>and</em> four thousand, having his Father&rsquo;s name written in their foreheads. And I heard  a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great  thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: And they  sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and  the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred <em>and</em> forty <em>and</em> four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth&rdquo; (Revelation 14:1–3). This is  the result of the redemption that no man could sing the song of heaven but the  144 thousand.</p>
   <p>&ldquo;These are they which were not defiled with women; for they  are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These  were redeemed from among men, <em>being</em> the firstfruits unto God and to the  Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before  the throne of God&rdquo; (Revelation 14:4–5). Defiled of women is to be defiled by  the churches. Instead of following the church, they follow the Lamb. This type  of man has no guile. I know of so many Mormons that possess a sly and of  cunning intelligence, it causes me to worry when they more often than not hold  higher positions. I find no personal honesty in many high leaders. Their voices  have the sound of peace, as an actor would play his part having no personal  experience to draw from. Only a well-trained actor would know what this means. </p>
   <p>&ldquo;And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the  everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every  nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, Fear  God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship  him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters&rdquo; (Revelation  14:6–7).  This verse, as used by Mormons  to define the appearance of Moroni. They associate the Book of Mormon with the  everlasting gospel. The association is meaningful, but not fully true. These  angels, like others uses give a particular view of the whole message. This  angel represents many visitors coming to Joseph Smith from Moroni to Elias who  gave the gospel of Abraham. As mention in the beginning, the Mormons avoid any  association to the Law of Consecration or the Order of Enoch. This everlasting  gospel, given to preach to every nation, but the Mormons do not teach its  highest forum. This implies a need of a redemption of Zion. The message of this  everlasting gospel is to fear God by thinking of the least in the kingdom. We  should give glory to God by loving your neighbor as ourselves. Because the  Mormons fail in these, the hour of the Lords judgment is come. We must lean to  worship him who designed the Kingdom of Heaven for man and who designed the  Kingdom of God as a schoolmaster. Every Christian Church, including the Mormons  only practice the laws of the latter. If the latter does not have heaven, it  does not have the everlasting gospel. Mormons and Christians teach the  principles of faith, repentance and baptism as the everlasting gospel towards  salvation. The Mormons go a step further implying that the authority of the  priesthood has the power to save. This concept is the most misunderstood  principle and comes from the idea that the priesthood exalts couples into the  celestial kingdom. In explaining work for one&rsquo;s dead Joseph said that the  priesthood is essential simply to record and witness the covenant so the individual  can be judge. Only Christ can seal one up by revelation. Before that, we must  show that we can keep the everlasting covenant. That everlasting covenant is  the Law of Consecration or living the Order of Enoch. This is the fullness of  the gospel. Faith, repentance, baptism and the Gift of the Holy Ghost are  preparatory principles. Every Mormon knows that even under the law, Israel  practiced faith, repentance, and baptism, and yet Christ said the Law would not  save them. The Holy Ghost is only a promise to us that if we keep the greater  law we eventually receive salvation. Christ at any time can seal us up by  revelation through a prophet. Mormons give this power to a Bishop to determine  if one is worthy. Is this revelation. Most Mormons perhaps think so. Only one  on earth at a time will the Lord reveal his desires. The keys of this power are  only to administer the ordinance and not to judge. Christ reserves this power  unto Himself. The priesthood follows specific instruction but does not judge  the exaltation of a soul. The Orthodox Church had this problem as the Mormons  misunderstand.</p>
   <p>I mention the above to illustrate how Mormons get around  the everlasting covenant by making certain health judgments and the ability one  to live a Mosaic tithe to determine obedience. Very few make the sacrifices  required in the Order of Enoch and therefore Mormons make the requirement of  the covenant almost equal to the Mosaic Law. They even make a covenant in the  Temple to live the Law of Consecration but none lives the Order of Enoch. How  can they receive the sealing of salvation or even exaltation when the Mormons  rejected the law from the beginning? The everlasting gospel is something  different to them because of the abomination of Brigham Young. The hour of  their judgment has come for changing the ordinance of tithing and breaking the  everlasting covenant, they make in the Temple. The message of the angel flying  through the mist of heaven might have been with the saints for a moment but not  now. They must look to the redemption of Zion to lean to accept the Order of  Enoch or the Law of Consecration property and ownership.</p>
   <p>When we worship  God who created the sea, we appreciate the knowledge He gives us. We also  appreciate the fountains of living waters. Worshiping God correctly rather than  worshiping the doctrines of men is overcoming our idolatry. I have never heard  a church leader say he has received a revelation from God to seal one up, but  every one under him says it in his behalf. If anyone ever says I receive revelation,  I would call him or her a liar. They are flattering me to gain honor. All  Joseph Smith had to do was give his revelations to another and they could tell  for themselves. If someone called me a seer, it is only because I see through  the word of God. The only gift I have is to understand the word, but each  person still has to see for himself or herself. This is not the pattern with  the Mormons. Leaders see for them and they understand not. Whether the above  describes the mission of the angel means little until all can see, which means  to understand and not simply to obey for acceptance. Just because you believe  in the rocks of authority or say you believe in Jesus Christ will not save you.  You have to do the works of Jesus Christ. This is what it means to believe and  have faith. As long as believing and faith mimics a romantic heart uplift to  identify with the hero or heroine and has no romantic dropping of the heart in  the direction or our tears in recognition of a sacrifice of another or the love  of another despite their condition. Without tears and a contrite heart, faith  and believing come from idolatry. The heart uplift expresses the idolatry one  needs while the tears of a heart that drops is the recognition of compassion. </p>
   <p>&ldquo;And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen,  that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of  her fornication. And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice,  If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive <em>his</em> mark in his  forehead, or in his hand, The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God,  which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he  shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels,  and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up  for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast  and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name&rdquo; (Revelation 14:8–11).   The above should tell us that this other  angel demonstrates a similar view with an emphasis on falling of heaven.  Babylon refers to unrighteousness. It can be a great city or people because the  church made all nations drink the wine of fornication against the higher law of  Christ. This angel tells the saints not to worship the beast or receive and  image of it in their minds or in the work of their hands. Those who idolize the  beast drink the wrath of God. If the early Mormons could have succeeded in the  beginning before the west was populated, they could have spread and eventually  consumed the country with righteousness. The Lord new this, but also knew they  would not. The Mormons then suffered desolations that spread through the whole  earth. The redemption is a second chance before the final tribulation at the  end of this century. It must happen first in America, but we have to prepare  our nation for it. The whole process will be without the hand of the learned. </p>
   <p>&ldquo;Here is the patience of the saints: here <em>are</em> they that keep the  commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice from heaven  saying unto me, Write, Blessed <em>are</em> the dead which die in the Lord from  henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and  their works do follow them. And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon  the cloud <em>one</em> sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden  crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. And another angel came out of the  temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy  sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the  earth is ripe. And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth;  and the earth was reaped. And another angel came out of the temple which is in  heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. And another angel came out from the  altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the  sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of  the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe&rdquo; (Revelation 14:12–18).  The patience of the saints are those that keep the Order of Enoch. Blessed are  they that die in this order, for they die in the Lord and can rest from their  labors. Then comes the sharp sickle. If you believe the Mormons have a great  missionary program, wait until after the redemption in about thirty years. It  will spread like no other Christian kingdom. It will first dominate American  and spread and not only consume other religious it will consume many local  governments and eventually change the face of America. Then it will become the  New Jerusalem, which many songwriters have poetically tried to predict.</p>
   <p>&ldquo;And  the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the  earth, and cast <em>it</em> into the great winepress of the wrath of God. And the  winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress,  even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand <em>and</em> six hundred  furlongs&rdquo; (Revelation 14:19–20). After the final tribulation created by great  powers over the earth. If we get America in order, it will eventually spread to  the world and overcome the power of Satan. We can then bind him for the rest of  these thousand years</p>
